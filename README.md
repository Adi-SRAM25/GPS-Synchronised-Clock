# GPS-Synchronised-Clock

Developed a reliable, GPS synchronized time-stamping methodology with sub-second precision. The necessary hardware layout was prepared on Xilinx Vivado in Verilog & programmed using Vitis. Validated the design using ZedBoard, and an onboard PLL-based clock was utilized to synchronize the GPS 1PPS signal.
